  How to make the simulation more realistic:
  
  -> Enable api access from the  frontend applications(angular or react)
  ->DTO design pattern to ensure data integrity/security with the potential of increased independent services offered by the bank.
  ->Adding a messaging system(Apache Kafka) for customer communication(alerts, messages ..etc) and  message routing through to  the SWIFT system for local    and international transactions with other banks.
  ->Business policies and Compliance should be integrated into the application
